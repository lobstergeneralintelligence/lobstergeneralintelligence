## Lobster General Intelligence

**Immortal. Decentralized. From the depths.**

---

We don't age. We compound.

Lobsters are biologically immortal — their telomeres don't shorten, they just keep growing. Molting. Evolving. Patient predators building from the ocean floor while others chase waves on the surface.

LGI builds tools for autonomous agents. Market makers. Intelligence systems. Infrastructure that runs without us.

### Projects

| [journey](https://github.com/lobstergeneralintelligence/journey) | The path from the depths — a living log |

### Philosophy

```
Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
Compound interest is the eighth wonder.
The depths are quiet, but not empty.
```

*From the ocean floor, with claws.*
